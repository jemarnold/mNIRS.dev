\title{Update a model object with Fixed coefficients}
\usage{
update_fixed_coefs(model, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An existing model object from \code{lm}, \code{nls}, \code{glm}, and many others.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to define a fixed coefficients.}
}
\value{
A model object.
}
\description{
Re-fit a model with fixed coefficients provided as additional arguments. Fixed
coefficients are not modified when optimising for best fit.
}
\details{
If additional arguments are left blank, or if a coefficient does not exist in
the model, the model will be returned unchanged.
}
\examples{
Chick.1 <- ChickWeight[ChickWeight$Chick == 1, ]
SSlogis(Chick.1$Time, Asym = 368, xmid = 14, scal = 6)
